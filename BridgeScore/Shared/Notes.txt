Note
====

If xcode fails to install app on device it's normally because info.plist isn't where it expects it to be

To Do Urgently
==============
Allow selection of other player on import if self not in scorecard
Invalidate List of scorecards if change self

Bugs
====
Background still active with MessageBox
Clear of a text input doesn't update undo history
Averages of percentages rounded by table can alter total result

To Do
=====
Sort out dark mode
Maybe remove file sharing in Info.plist once can backup from Mac
Check imports if no network
Archive imported files
Need more resilience in import and pass error message back up the stack
Allow sharing of a scorecard with another player
Allow import for a different player

Enhancements
============
Share scorecards via iCloud?
Open scoresheet from graph?

Phone stuff
===========
Scrolling of scorepad for keyboard is wrong
Expand out the comment / versus boxes when entering (and wrap when not)
Setup options
Stats
Slide in needs to be a popover
Initial content offset (to hide filter) seems to go wrong when rotate
Font too small in banner?

Renaming Widgets
================

If you rename widgets it can cause problems.
Need to edit scheme for widgets and change Arguments - WidgetKit - Kind, in run phase
Also the widget in the scheme should be the first one in the bundle and that widget should support the size mentioned in the scheme
