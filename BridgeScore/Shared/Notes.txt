Note
====

If xcode fails to install app on device it's normally because info.plist isn't where it expects it to be

Bugs
====
Background still active with MessageBox
Totals not right if have entered a partial table - I.e. one board

To Do
=====
Sort out dark mode
Maybe remove file sharing in Info.plist once can backup from Mac
Travellers and rankings in portrait
Check imports if no network
Archive imported files

Enhancements
============
Share scorecards via iCloud?
Open scoresheet from graph?
Phone mode??
