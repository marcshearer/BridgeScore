Note
====

If xcode fails to install app on device it's normally because info.plist isn't where it expects it to be

Bugs
====
Seem to lose tricks made periodically when scroll - think this now fixed
Can only type in one number in score as it keeps clearing field - have to go out and in again
    Is due to full refresh being triggered continuously - add an onChange to clear it

To Do
=====
Sort out dark mode
Maybe remove file sharing in Info.plist once can backup from Mac
Show names from import converted now rather than from snapshot at time of import

Enhancements
============
Share scorecards via iCloud?
Open scoresheet from graph?
Phone mode?
