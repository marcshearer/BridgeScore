Note
====

If xcode fails to install app on device it's normally because info.plist isn't where it expects it to be

Bugs
====
Background still active with MessageBox
Don't seem to consider ties when allocate position

To Do
=====
Sort out dark mode
Maybe remove file sharing in Info.plist once can backup from Mac
Check imports if no network
Archive imported files

Enhancements
============
Share scorecards via iCloud?
Open scoresheet from graph?

Phone stuff
===========
Scrolling of scorepad for keyboard is wrong
Expand out the comment / versus boxes when entering (and wrap when not)
Setup options
Stats
Slide in needs to be a popover
Initial content offset (to hide filter) seems to go wrong when rotate
Font too small in banner?
BBO hand play
