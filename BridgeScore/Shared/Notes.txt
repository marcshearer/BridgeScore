Note
====

If xcode fails to install app on device it's normally because info.plist isn't where it expects it to be

Bugs
====
Background still active with MessageBox
Filter persists after layouts, but is not coloured and empty when click on button

To Do
=====
Sort out dark mode
Maybe remove file sharing in Info.plist once can backup from Mac
Unlock after import
Travellers and rankings in portrait

Enhancements
============
Share scorecards via iCloud?
Open scoresheet from graph?
Phone mode??
