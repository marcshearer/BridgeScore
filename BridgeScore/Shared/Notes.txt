Note
====

If fails to install it's normally because info.plist isn't where it expects it to be

Bugs
====
New layout doesn't have partner (or location?) unless you change it
Keyboard pops up when click on contract

To Do
=====

Better representation of declarer - E.g. N/Self
Crash recovery
Scroll seems too easy on contracts - make them sideways or remove them?
Keyboard slide up as in edit
Sort out dark mode
Maybe remove file sharing in Info.plist once can backup from Mac
Should add scores rather than averaging them for some match types
Need more match types - e.g. for Swiss Pairs in VPs
Total for the whole match
Lock entered scorecards

Enhancements
============
Filter list of scorecards
Share scorecards via iCloud?
Stats?
